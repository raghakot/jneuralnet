# jneuralnet
My attempt at building a neural network framework back in school days.
This started largely as an attempt to demystify and understand how neural nets and backpropogation worked.

This was originally hosted on https://kenai.com/projects/jneuralnet which is shutting down pretty soon. 
My remaining todo back then was to implement grid search to automatically select architecture.

Needless to say, I am no longer working on this actively. This is mostly left for nostalgic reasons.
